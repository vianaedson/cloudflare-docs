Consider the following common issues and troubleshooting steps when using [Cloudflare origin CA](/ssl/origin-configuration/origin-ca/).

## NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID

### Cause
<Render file="origin-ca-pause-error" />

This also means that SSL Labs or similar SSL validators are expected to flag the certificate as invalid.

### Solutions

- Make sure the [proxy status](/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) of your DNS records and any [page rules](/rules/page-rules/) (if existing) are set up correctly. If so, you can try to turn proxying off and then on again and wait a few minutes.
- If you must have direct connections between clients and your origin server, consider installing a publicly trusted certificate at your origin instead. This process is done outside of Cloudflare, where you should issue the certificate directly from a <GlossaryTooltip term="Certificate Authority (CA)">certificate authority (CA)</GlossaryTooltip> of your choice. You can still use Full (strict) [encryption mode](/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/), as long as the CA is listed on the [Cloudflare trust store](https://github.com/cloudflare/cfssl_trust).

## The issuer of this certificate could not be found

### Cause
Some origin web servers require that you upload the Cloudflare origin CA root certificate or certificate chain.

### Solution
Use the following links to download either an ECC or an RSA version and upload to your origin web server:

* [Cloudflare Origin ECC PEM](/ssl/static/origin_ca_ecc_root.pem) (do not use with Apache cPanel)
* [Cloudflare Origin RSA PEM](/ssl/static/origin_ca_rsa_root.pem)

## The certificate is not trusted in all web browsers

### Cause
Apache cPanel requires that you upload the Cloudflare origin CA root certificate or certificate chain.

### Solution
Use the following link to download an RSA version of the root certificate and upload it to your origin web server:

* [Cloudflare Origin RSA PEM](/ssl/static/origin_ca_rsa_root.pem)
