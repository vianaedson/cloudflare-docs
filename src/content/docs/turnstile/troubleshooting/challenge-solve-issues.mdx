## Challenge loops

You may encounter a challenge loop where the challenge keeps reappearing without being solved. This can happen for several reasons:

- **Network issues**: Poor or unstable network connections can prevent the challenge from being completed.
- **Browser configuration**: Some browser settings or extensions may block the scripts needed to execute the challenge.
- **Unsupported browsers**: Using a browser that is not supported by Turnstile.
- **JavaScript disabled**: Turnstile relies on JavaScript to function properly.
- **Detection errors**: If Turnstile suspects bot-like behavior, you may encounter repeated challenges for verification.

Most challenges are quick and should take only a few seconds to complete. If it takes longer, ensure your network is stable and follow the [troubleshooting steps](#troubleshooting).

:::note
If the issue persists, try switching to a different network or device to rule out any issues with your browser environment.

Make sure that your browser is updated to the latest version.
