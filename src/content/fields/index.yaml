    description: |-
      This corresponds to the string after the last dot in the URI path, excluding the query string.

Having a dot as the first character does not represent a file extension and is commonly used in UNIX-like systems to denote a hidden file or directory.

      Example values:

      - If the URI path is `/articles/index.html`, the field value will be `"html"`.
      - If the URI path is `/articles/index.`, the field value will be an empty string (`""`).
